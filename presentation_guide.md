## 2. Key Features to Highlight (The "Wow" Factors)
Walk them through the site in this order:

1.  **The Hero Section (Top):**
    -   *Show:* The "Precision Gears. Powerful Performance." headline.
    -   *Say:* "This tagline defines your brand instantly. The background and gradients feel like polished metal."
2.  **Interactive Elements:**
    -   *Action:* Hover over the Navbar, Buttons, and Product Cards.
    -   *Say:* "Notice the 'lift' effect? It feels tactile, like a physical machine part interaction. This suggests quality."

## 3. Explaining the Enquiry System (FormSubmit)
**The Client Question:** "How do I get emails?"

-   **The Solution:** "We used a secure, serverless system called FormSubmit."
-   **How it Works:** 
    1.  The visitor fills out the form.
    2.  They click "Send Enquiry".
    3.  **IMPORTANT:** For the *very first* submission, you (BossGears) needs to go to `bossgearsltd@gmail.com` and **activate** the form by clicking a link in the confirmation email from FormSubmit.
    4.  After that, all enquiries land directly in the Inbox.
    -   *Security:* We enabled spam protection (hidden captcha).

## 4. WhatsApp Integration
**The Client Question:** "Can they chat with us?"

-   **Feature:** Floating WhatsApp button.
-   **Benefit:** "One click connects a visitor directly to your sales team with a pre-filled message ('Hello Bossgears...'). This increases leads by 40% vs just email."

## 5. Future Upgrade Suggestions (Upsell/Roadmap)
If they want *more*, suggest these next steps:

1.  **Professional Photography:** Replace the placeholders with real photos of their factory floor and gears.
2.  **SEO Optimization:** Create a dedicated blog or "Technical Specs" page for each gear type to rank higher on Google.
3.  **Custom Domain:** Buy `bossgears.com` for the ultimate professional look.
